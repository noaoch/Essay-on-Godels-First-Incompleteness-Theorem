# Godels-First-Incompleteness-Theorem

This repo contains my work for MAT495: Independent Reading in Math, supervised by Professor Todorcevic, during my undergrad studies at UofT. 

To anyone who may be interested, the PDF file is a textbook-style essay I wrote, aimed to document two beautiful proofs for Godel's First Incompleteness Theorem. While composing the essay, I tried my best to make it easy to read, succinct, and as self-contained as possible, so that it doesn't confuse any beginners in mathematical logic.

Anyways, thanks for stopping by, and best wishes in your studies!   :)
